# Diversity/Inclusion rider

If I speak at an event then I will expect the following:

- A clear (and clearly enforced) code of conduct.
- Members of underrepresented groups as active participants (speakers, panel
  members etc).

If you are unable to evidence this, I will not be participating.

As I continue to learn and gain awareness on issues surrounding diversity and
inclusion I expect I will update this page.
