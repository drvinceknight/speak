# What is research software?

## Abstract

Research software is vital to research.

In this talk I will discuss what could be meant by the term "research software".

I will show some examples of research software in the field of game theory (and
others) but
also give an overview of what the published literature says on the topic.

This will conclude with a proposal for a definition of research software with a
discussion of the inherent difficulties and opportunities.
