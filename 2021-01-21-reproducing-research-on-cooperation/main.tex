        % This is a tweet I specifically liked. The idea going on here (I
        % believe), is that we want to study if a specific Lizard is going to
        % dominate another. Perhaps this gets correlated to some genetic marker
        % or even prior behaviour.

        % The reason I like this tweet, is that it is a nice illustration of
        % game theory. Game theory is the study of outcomes based on behaviour
        % in rule based systems. So for example: the lizard that was not fed is
        % more likely to fight and win the warm part of the coop perhaps?

        % [CLICK] Here is the output

        % And the reason this tweet is cool is because it evidences the need for
        % the subject: sometimes out of simple systems we do not get the
        % behaviour we expect. Indeed, here cooperative behaviour has emerged.

        % A well used game (set of rules) is the Prisoners Dilemma. You might
        % have heard of this game before, the general concept is that you have
        % the option to cooperate or defect when encountering someone else.
        % Cooperation is essentially the selfish action: giving a bit to ensure
        % the individual you encounter gains more. Defection on the other hand
        % is the selfish action: take whatever you can.
        % When both cooperate it's good for both (for example the lizards).
