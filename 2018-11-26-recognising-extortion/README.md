# Recognising extortion.

The Prisoners Dilemma is often one of the first games taught in any game theory
course. Despite or in fact perhaps because of, its simplicity it continues to be
used and studied as a model of the basis of all inter agent interaction.

In this talk a brief overview of the research will be given: including the
important work of Press and Dyson who in 2012 described a theoretic behaviour of
extortion that could apparently not be bested.  The talk will describe current
and ongoing work showing that this is an incomplete picture. Not only are
complex behaviours evolutionarily competitive but in fact they are able to
recognise extortion and defeat it. This will be demonstrated through the results
of reinforcement learning but also, conceptually using linear least squares.

This talk should be of interest to any of the following:

- game theorists and/or agent based modellers,
- research software engineers (the work makes use of an open research code
  base),
- people looking for some background noise whilst they check their emails,
- anyone who would like some mathematically robust hope that it is in fact
  possible for us to all get along.
