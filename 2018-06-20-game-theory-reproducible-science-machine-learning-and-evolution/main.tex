        % My PhD involved writing a number of mathematical proofs. In some sense

        % jar of solution for example. Science is essentially about
        % communicating instructions. There was one proof in my PhD, not a major
        % one, it was 4 pages long when I took it to my supervisor (a brilliant
        % mathematician). We worked on it together and reduced it to 2 pages.
        % Just before submitting I thought I managed to get it down to a couple
        % of paragraphs.  My external, read those couple of paragraphs and
        % attempted to "reproduce the science" which in mathematics is
        % essentially just checking that the proof is correct. He immediately
        % found that my couple of paragraphs was missing a number of important
        % details. I was able to immediately recall the 2 page proof and that
        % was a simple fix to my thesis.  This was science at work and in
        % general perhaps mathematics does not suffer from this as a problem.

                And I really wanted to thank you all, I discovered your project because of a
                course where we needed to participate in an open source project, and I had the
                occasion to compare the welcome me and my coworkers received here compared to
                other people from my class who worked on different project. And I've got to said
                you are awesome on that part and on the help your provide to newbies ￼ I like
                your project so I'll try to continue to contribute now and then !
