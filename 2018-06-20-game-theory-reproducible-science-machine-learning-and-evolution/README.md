# Game Theory, reproducible science, reinforcement learning and evolution.

Reproducing scientific research is hard. Doing scientific research in an open
way is hard.

Whether or not you agree with those two sentences: that point of view actively
shapes the state of scientific research.

In this talk I will describe a particular area of game theoretic research that
gained a large amount of popularity in the 1980s: Robert Axelrod carried out a
computer tournament aiming to understand behaviour in the Prisoner's Dilemma.
This work has over 39k citations but has yet to be reproduced. Indeed: some of
the code used has been described as "lost".

In 2015 an open source project was put on github (the Axelrod-Python project).
This project in some ways emulated the work of Robert Axelrod. As well as
proving to welcome contributions from a range of expertise, this work has
resulted in open scientific insights (and publications). This includes the use of
reinforcement learning to understand not only the evolution of cooperation but
further indications of speciation such as handshake mechanisms.

This talk should be of interest to a wide range of audiences:

- It will cover aspects and trends in the area of sustainable software
  practice for research.
- It will give a historic account of historically important work in the
  field of game theory (as well as describing the best attempt to reproduce
  it).
- It will describe a successful open research project benefiting from the
  contributions of a diverse range of: academics, hobbyists and secondary school
  students.
