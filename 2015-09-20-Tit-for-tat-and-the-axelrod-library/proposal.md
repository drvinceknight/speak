# Session title: Tit for Tat, Evolution, Game Theory and the Python Axelrod Library

## Type of session

Long talk (30 minutes including questions)

## Your audience

Suitable to a general (non coder) audience interested in learning about a
compsci/mathematical subject **but** also suitable for the proficient coder
aiming to either participant in a coding tournament and/or contribute to a
growing yet new Python library.

## Is your session beginner-friendly?

Yes.

## Description

This talk will begin with the origin of species. More precisely with a
discussion of Darwin's theory of evolution and how Game Theory has been used to
explain/illustrate aspects of cooperation in complex dynamics.

In 1980, professor Robert Axelrod created a computer tournament inviting
submission of code snippets that would compete against each other. A large amount of
academic study has concentrated on the outcomes of this experiment. The particularity
of the outcome, was that even when the tournament was repeated with a much
larger number of strategies, a very simple strategy was victorious: Tit for Tat.
This strategy tries it's best to cooperate with other strategies!

The talk will briefly discuss all of this but will concentrate on a new Python
library (`pip install axelrod`). This project, hosted on github allows anyone to
recreate the tournament but also (and arguably more importantly) submit
strategies via pull request!

It is anticipated that this talk would be appreciated by coders of all levels as
it gives a very low entry level for a contribution to an open source project. It
should also be of interest to the more experienced coders as it is hoped that
novel strategies will be devised and submitted. Indeed, historically strategies
have been mainly devised by mathematicians and economists, surely the pyconuk
attendees will bring something new to the repository?

Finally, for those who are not interested in 'playing along' the talk will also
describe the newest addition to the project which is a Django project aiming to
bring this study of evolution to a popular audience.

## Would you like your proposal to be reviewed by an experienced speaker?

No? (have tweet @pyconuk - am not sure what this question is about).

## Is there anything else we should know?

The start of the talk will probably involve some engaging audience participation
as we aim to recreate a bit of Axelrod's tournament 'live'.

This talk could also take the form of a short talk if this is helpful.
