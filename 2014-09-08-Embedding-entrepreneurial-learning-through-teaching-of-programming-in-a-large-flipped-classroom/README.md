# Embedding entrepreneurial learning through the teaching of programming in a large flipped classroom

Abstract:

Should the modern mathematician know how to code? This is a question that has been answered positively by the School of Mathematics at Cardiff University.
This talk will describe the pedagogic approaches used to deliver a first year programming class to 160+ first year students.

Delivered over two terms, the first term uses a flipped classroom to enable students with programming knowledge and tools.
In the second term, entrepreneurial skills are embedded in the course as  students form companies to make use of their coding skills and mathematical knowledge.

The talk will describe the various innovative pedagogic approaches including the scaffolding put in place, as well the different types of formative and summative assessment used to ensure a well rounded student centred learning experience.
